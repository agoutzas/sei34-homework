// MTA Lab
// Objectives:
// Apply your knowledge of Javascript to solve a real world problem.
// Get really good at array manipulation.
// Activity
// Create a program that models a simple subway system.
//
// The program takes the line and stop that a user is getting on at and the line and
// stop that user is getting off at and prints the journey and the total number of
// stations for the trip in the console:
//
// planTrip('N', 'Times Square', '6', '33rd'); // This is only a suggested function
// name and signature.
//
// // console.log() shows output similar to this:
// // "You must travel through the following stops on the N line: 34th, 28th, 23rd,
// Union Square."
// // "Change at Union Square."
// // "Your journey continues through the following stops: 23rd, 28th, 33rd."
// // "7 stops in total."
// There are 3 subway lines:
// The N line has the following stops: Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th
// The L line has the following stops: 8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st
// The 6 line has the following stops: Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square,
// and Astor Place.
// All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection
// points. (For example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different than the
// 28th street stop on the 6 line, so you'll have to differentiate this when you name
// your stops in the arrays.)
// Tell the user the number of stops AND the stops IN ORDER that they will pass through
// or change at.
// Hints:
// Work out how you would do it on paper first! Then start to explain that process in
// Javascript.
// Get the program to work for a single line before trying to tackle multiple lines.
// Don't worry about prompting the user for input. Hard code some values to get it working.
// You can use prompt() later to make it more interactive.
// Consider diagramming the lines by sketching out the subway lines and their stops and
// intersection.
// The key to the lab is finding the index positions of each stop. (hint: indexOf())
// Make sure the stops that are the same for different lines have different names (i.e.
// 23rd on the N and on the 6 need to be differentiated)
